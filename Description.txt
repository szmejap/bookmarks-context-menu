The extension will recreate the structure of a single bookmark folder (selected in configuration options) in a selection context menu. As a result, all bookmarks in the folder will become available under the right-click menu (i.e. context menu). Selected text can be passed to bookmarks to enable searching for the selected string under a given bookmarks address.

The extension essentially substitutes a (configurable) string of characters (a regular expression) in any bookmark under the configured folder. For example "http://www.example.org/?search=%s" becomes "http://www.example.org/?search=[selected text]", where "[selected text]" is whatever is currently selected ('%s' is the default substituted text).

With it you can define custom search addresses in multilingual dictionaries, news sites, stock information sites, or simply any search engine, without the need to configure Firefox search. Simply drop a bookmark in the folder, change the part of the URL that contains the search string, and you're all set.

Folder structure is reflected, so any sub-folders will show up, as sub-menus.

To start, simply create a bookmark folder called "Context Bookmarks" anywhere, and put a bookmark pointing to "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s" and named "DuckDuckGo" in that folder. Next, select any text, right-click, and use the new "DuckDuckGo" context item under the "Search ..." context menu folder.
